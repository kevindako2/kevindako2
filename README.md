# Hi, I’m Kenneth

✨ Welcome to my GitHub!
I’m a passionate developer and Epitech student, always curious, always building, and always learning 📚.
My main interests revolve around Artificial Intelligence 🤖, Cybersecurity 🔐, and the never-ending adventure of solving problems through code ⚡.

🧑‍💻 About Me

🎓 Student at Epitech — studying computer science with a strong focus on system programming, algorithms, and web technologies.
🌍 Languages: English & French.
🎮 Passion for game development and interactive systems.
🚀 Always exploring new fields, from low-level programming to full-stack web development, from algorithms to AI.
💻 Tech Stack & Skills
🛠️ Programming Languages
C / C++ → System programming, memory management, algorithm design (sorting, pathfinding, optimization).
Python 🐍 → Automation, problem solving, and first steps into AI & data science.
JavaScript / TypeScript → Web applications, frontend & backend.
🌐 Web Development
Frontend: React ⚛️, Next.js 🌐
Backend: Symfony 🏗️, REST APIs
Full-stack projects: Combining system logic with web technologies to build efficient apps.
⚙️ System Programming

Advanced experience in low-level programming with C/C++.

Process management, memory handling, file parsing.

Worked on algorithm-heavy projects (sorting, pathfinding, logical programming).

🎮 Game Development

Building gameplay logic & systems.
Experimenting with C++ and algorithms applied to game mechanics.
🤖 AI & 🔐 Cybersecurity (Current Focus)
Deep interest in Artificial Intelligence: from algorithms to applied projects.
Exploring cybersecurity concepts, from secure coding practices to system vulnerabilities.

🚀 Projects & Experience

🔹 System Programming:

Process handling, parsing Linux /proc files.
Implemented sorting algorithms (Radix sort, etc.) and pathfinding algorithms.

🔹 Web Development:

Built web apps using React + Next.js (modern frontend) and Symfony (backend).
Worked with REST APIs, UI/UX logic, and responsive layouts.

🔹 Algorithmic Projects:

Sorting algorithms (radix sort, custom comparator-based sorting).
Pathfinding (graph theory, shortest path algorithms).
Other logical/optimization algorithms.

🔹 Games & Simulations:

Applied system logic & algorithm design to interactive projects.
Built small game systems as side projects 🎮.

🌟 What I’m Looking For
Opportunities to contribute to open-source projects 👐.
Collaborations in AI, cybersecurity, or system-level programming.
Learning and exchanging with passionate developers from around the world 🌍.
