# Hi, I’m Kevin “-‿-”
✨ Welcome to my GitHub!

### About Me
I’m a passionate developer and Epitech student, driven by curiosity and a love for technology.
My main interests are Artificial Intelligence 🤖 and Cybersecurity 🔐, but I’ve also gained strong experience in system programming, web development (React, Next.js, Sanity), and algorithm design.
🌍 Fluent in English & French, I enjoy collaborating and sharing knowledge.
Always learning, always building — because growth never stops.
⚡ Challenges motivate me: whether it’s a low-level tool, a web app, or a game project, I put energy and passion into every line of code.

# Tech Stack & Skills
### 🛠️ Programming Languages
I code in :
- C/C++ → system programming, algorithms (sorting, pathfinding, you name it!) ⚙️
- JavaScript/TypeScript → full-stack vibes with React ⚛️ & Next.js 🌐
- Python 🐍 → automation, AI explorations & problem-solving

### 🌐 Web Development
- Frontend: React ⚛️, Next.js 🌐
- CMS & Data: Sanity 📊 (headless content management)
-Full-stack projects: Combining system logic with web technologies to build efficient apps.

### ⚙️ System Programming
