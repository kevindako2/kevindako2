# Hi, I’m Kevin 🙃
✨ Welcome to my GitHub!

## About Me
I’m a passionate developer and Epitech student, driven by curiosity and a love for technology.
My main interests are Artificial Intelligence 🤖 and Cybersecurity 🔐, but I’ve also gained strong experience in system programming, web development (React, Next.js, Sanity), and algorithm design.
🌍 Fluent in English & French, I enjoy collaborating and sharing knowledge.
📚 Always learning, always building — because growth never stops.
⚡ Challenges motivate me: whether it’s a low-level tool, a web app, or a game project, I put energy and passion into every line of code.

# Tech Stack & Skills
### Programming Languages
I code in :
- C/C++ → system programming, algorithms (sorting, pathfinding, you name it!) ⚙️
- JavaScript/TypeScript → full-stack vibes with React ⚛️ & Next.js 🌐
- Python 🐍 → automation, AI explorations & problem-solving

### 🌐 Web Development
- Frontend: React ⚛️, Next.js 🌐
- CMS & Data: Sanity 📊 (headless content management)
-Full-stack projects: Combining system logic with web technologies to build efficient apps.

# ⚙️ System Programming
- Advanced experience in low-level programming with C/C++.
- Process management, memory handling, file parsing.
- Worked on algorithm-heavy projects (sorting, pathfinding, logical programming).

# 🎮 Game Development
- Building gameplay logic & systems in Csfml & Sfml (C and C++ frameworks).
- Experimenting with C++ and algorithms applied to game mechanics.

# 🤖 AI & 🔐 Cybersecurity (Current Focus)
-Deep interest in Artificial Intelligence: from algorithms to applied projects.
-Exploring cybersecurity concepts, from secure coding practices to system vulnerabilities.

⚡ Fun Fact

If it challenges me, I’m in.
If it mixes logic + creativity, I’ll probably spend hours on it without noticing -_- ✨
